# Complete form of Proposition 3.1

This module gives one declaration containing every finite and asymptotic
clause of Proposition 3.1.  The finite clauses retain the exact multiplication
identity as well as its natural-division consequence.  Both limits in equation
(9) concern the same concrete prime-power graph and use its actual common
degree, not merely the displayed upper bound.

/-- The finite claims of Proposition 3.1 for the concrete graph over the
chosen field of cardinality `q`.

The named fields expose the five claims in the paper: regularity with the
actual common degree, the exact order in multiplication and division form
(equation (6)), the sharp degree cap (equation (7)), and exact extended
diameter (equation (8)). -/

/-- **Proposition 3.1 (complete formal statement).**

For every prime-power field order, the concrete halved-flag graph satisfies
all finite claims in equations (6)--(8).  As the field order tends to infinity
through all prime powers, its actual degree divided by the cap and its exact
order divided by the `k`-th power of that actual degree both tend to one, as in
equation (9). -/

This is the exact algebraic bridge used in the proof of Theorem 1.1.  It is
proved from the bundled declaration `proposition_3_1`, rather than by invoking
the independently available cap-normalized limit.  Pointwise, after the
nonzero denominators have been discharged, the identity is

`N / K^k = (N / Δ^k) * (Δ / K)^k`. -/
